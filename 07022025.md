Most stablecoin bridges feel like duct-tape solutions — quick fixes layered on top of fragile trust assumptions. **xReserve from Circle**, however, is built differently. It is designed as *infrastructure*, not a workaround.

So who is already running xReserve live, and what are they using it for?

## Early Live Integrations

**Canton Network** was the first to go live in December 2025. The institutional blockchain, built by Digital Asset, launched **USDCx** for 24/7 settlement of tokenized securities and B2B payments. Partners such as **Bron**, **CertiK**, and **Cumberland DRW** already route treasury flows through the network.

**Stacks** brought USDC-backed dollars to Bitcoin DeFi. USDCx on Stacks is fully backed by USDC held in Circle’s reserve contract and enabled via **Circle’s CCTP**. Wallets and platforms like **Xverse**, **Asigna**, and **Granite** now support multi-asset lending and BTC-collateralized loans — without rehypothecation.

**Aleo** is taking a different approach. Its testnet runs a private version of USDCx built with zero-knowledge proofs. The asset remains 100% backed, but transactions are confidential — designed for use cases that require privacy guarantees while still maintaining regulatory compliance. In January 2026, **Cardano announced the Midnight Network integration**, bringing privacy-preserving USDCx into the Cardano DeFi ecosystem.

## The Infrastructure Beneath

At the base layer, deposits move through **Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)**. By the end of 2025, CCTP had moved approximately **$126 billion across 19 blockchains**, establishing itself as one of the most battle-tested stablecoin rails in production.

Circle is also building its own Layer-1, **Arc**, as a settlement layer for stablecoin-native finance. During its testnet phase, Arc processed over **150 million transactions in just 90 days**. Products like **StableFX** already allow institutions to trade stablecoin pairs 24/7 with instant settlement.

## A Shift in the Trust Model

xReserve itself is a smart contract that holds USDC to back partner-issued stablecoins **1:1**. Instead of relying on external bridge providers, backing is verified via attestations. This fundamentally changes the trust model:

- No third-party bridge risk  
- Direct reliance on Circle plus the partner chain’s own infrastructure  
- Clear, auditable backing guarantees  

The result is a system that actually works across heterogeneous blockchain environments.

## Infrastructure, Not Experiment

The rails are live. **Canton and Stacks are already operational**, Aleo is testing privacy-first deployments, and the reference specification has proven viable across multiple architectures.

xReserve doesn’t try to reinvent stablecoins — it quietly does the hard infrastructure work required to make them usable at scale.
