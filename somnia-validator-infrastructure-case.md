When **Somnia’s testnet launched in April 2025**, we joined early as validators. But beyond running infrastructure, we quickly noticed something missing in the ecosystem.

There was no proper way for delegators to *discover validators, compare them, or understand staking performance*. Nodes existed, but decision-making was fragmented and opaque. That gap became the starting point for everything that followed.

## Identifying the Gap

Running a validator gives you a unique perspective. During the early testnet phase, delegators faced a clear problem:

- Validators were launching rapidly  
- Performance data was scattered  
- Commission structures were unclear  
- There was no unified view of reliability or uptime  

Delegation decisions were being made with incomplete information.

We proposed a clear idea to the Somnia team:  
**build a comprehensive validator and staking analytics platform that makes participation transparent.**

The team agreed. We started building.

## The Product: Somnia.info

Our vision was not a simple stats page, but a *reference dashboard* for the entire ecosystem — something delegators would actually use.

Somnia.info was designed with a **GTA-style interface**: dense, functional, and data-driven. The platform includes:

- Validator discovery and comparison  
- Commission structures and voting power  
- Delegation volumes and uptime tracking  
- APR / APY calculations with historical data  
- Network decentralization metrics  
- Transaction and network activity analytics  

Everything needed to make informed staking decisions — in one place.

By the time **Somnia mainnet launched in September**, Somnia.info was already complete. On **October 23rd**, we announced it publicly — a live platform aggregating validator data, network analytics, and staking tools in real time.

## Running a Validator and Building Infrastructure

What made this work is that these were never separate activities.

We joined Somnia’s validator set during the **Shannon testnet** as part of the earliest cohort. By testnet end:

- Performance score: **93 / 100**  
- Uptime: **100%**  

When Somnia processed **80 million transactions in 24 hours**, our validator stayed fully operational. We were part of the system proving the network’s throughput under real load.

At the same time, we continuously analyzed and shared insights from inside the ecosystem — grounded in actual operator experience, not speculation. This consistency built trust with both the community and the Somnia team.

Infrastructure, product, and communication reinforced each other.

## How It All Connected

By September, Somnia launched mainnet with **70+ projects** and enterprise validators including **Google Cloud**. We shipped as **genesis validators**, with Somnia.info already live and functional.

By October, when the platform was publicly announced:

- Delegators were already using it  
- Validator comparisons were transparent  
- Network health was visible in real time  

Somnia.info became a practical tool for choosing where to stake — not marketing, not theory, but utility.

## The Takeaway

What worked here was refusing to separate validator operations from ecosystem building.

Most validators run nodes quietly.  
Most media players stay disconnected from infrastructure reality.  

We merged all three:
- Reliable validator operations  
- A product the ecosystem genuinely needed  
- Consistent analysis grounded in real technical understanding  

For **HighTower**, this case proves that infrastructure providers can become **infrastructure partners** — by identifying gaps and filling them early.

For the validator ecosystem, this is the model worth replicating:  
don’t just operate. **Contribute. Build. Amplify real signals honestly.**

Somnia.info is live now.  
It’s built by people running a genesis validator on Somnia — people inside the network every day, focused on making participation transparent and fair.
