# Midl × HighTower: Supporting Bitcoin Abstraction Infrastructure

We began following **Midl** closely in early 2025, when their devnet experiments revealed a fundamentally different approach to Bitcoin DeFi. Instead of relying on wrapped assets or external bridges, Midl is building a **native execution environment** — enabling smart contracts directly on Bitcoin while keeping users inside their BTC wallets.

Midl positions itself as a path for Bitcoin to support the same diverse dApp stack as Ethereum: **DeFi, InfoFi, SocialFi, GameFi, ICOs**, and more. Everything runs through an EVM-like development environment while remaining fully native for users — a standard Bitcoin wallet is all that’s required to interact with dApps built on Midl.

Most solutions we encountered before required moving BTC off-chain, introducing friction and new trust assumptions. Midl’s architecture stood out immediately, and it became clear this was a project worth tracking closely through **BTC Board**.

## Building the Relationship

We reached out to the Midl team in spring 2025 through their community channels. The discussion naturally focused on our work at **BTCBoard** — how we track Bitcoin infrastructure developments and provide consistent ecosystem coverage for teams building real technical solutions.

The team immediately understood the value of infrastructure-focused visibility. Projects building deep protocol-level technology often struggle with awareness, especially when their work requires careful technical explanation rather than short marketing soundbites.

## Our Coverage Approach

The weekly digest integration became our primary touchpoint. Every **BTCfi summary** we published included relevant Midl updates, allowing our audience to follow their progress alongside other Bitcoin-native infrastructure projects.

We also joined Midl’s AMA session in June, contributing infrastructure perspectives to discussions around Bitcoin-native execution environments and abstraction layers.

## Engagement and Ecosystem Presence

Starting in spring 2025, every weekly BTC Board digest featured Midl updates. Over time, engagement grew steadily as our audience became familiar with Midl’s technical approach and long-term vision.

This consistent presence led to deeper collaboration:

- Invitations to Midl-hosted Spaces  
- Participation in community discussions  
- Referrals of other infrastructure-focused projects for technical conversations  

---

## Measured Impact

Steady, non-promotional coverage helped Midl establish a recognizable presence within our content network. Rather than one-off spikes, visibility compounded over time as readers repeatedly encountered Midl in trusted ecosystem updates.

The collaboration reinforced our belief that **technical credibility scales best through consistency**, not hype.

---

## Key Learnings

This partnership worked because we focused on documenting real progress rather than producing promotional content. Regular technical coverage, community participation, and allowing development milestones to speak for themselves proved more effective than traditional marketing pushes.

Quality technical work deserves visibility.  
At HighTower, we help connect serious Bitcoin infrastructure projects with audiences who value substance over noise.
