# HighTower × BOB: A Case Study in Strategic Community Partnership

## Understanding BOB’s Potential

BOB (Build on Bitcoin) emerged as the gateway to Bitcoin DeFi by addressing a fundamental inefficiency: trillions of dollars in BTC exist, yet less than 0.1% participates in DeFi.

BOB unlocks this dormant liquidity by bringing EVM compatibility to Bitcoin, allowing developers to build Bitcoin-native applications using familiar Ethereum tooling.

By early 2025, BOB had accumulated over **250,000 users** and **$250M in TVL**.  
For HighTower, the opportunity was clear: dormant BTC liquidity waiting for the right infrastructure. The technical architecture made sense, the metrics showed real adoption, and the team consistently delivered.

## Building the Relationship

Our journey with BOB evolved organically over several months.

We began covering the project in late 2024, publishing research on Bitcoin DeFi infrastructure and tracking BOB’s growth metrics. As specialists in Bitcoin DeFi solutions, we’ve covered this space for over a year — and BOB stood out through both technical approach and execution.

In April 2025, X became our entry point. After exchanging public replies about their technology, we moved to a dedicated Telegram chat where we introduced our infrastructure services and offered to amplify their news. This informal channel became a testing ground for understanding their roadmap and demonstrating content quality.

By May, the relationship deepened. We shared draft research with BOB’s community team, who provided constructive feedback and internal resources. This collaborative editing process built mutual trust — they saw our technical competence, and we aligned with their messaging priorities.

## From Inquiry to Partnership

Partnership discussions emerged from our Guardian program inquiry, which led to a call outlining BOB’s evangelist system.

We negotiated flexible terms that preserved editorial independence while committing to weekly deliverables. Both sides understood the value exchange: we gained access and context, while BOB received consistent, high-quality technical coverage.

## Delivering Beyond Expectations

Starting in late May, we committed to one substantial piece per week, but quickly expanded this into comprehensive multi-channel coverage.

Over the summer, we produced **50+ BOB-related pieces**, including:

- Bitcoin DeFi gateway deep-dives reaching **19k impressions**
- Campaign explainers with **15.8k impressions**
- Bitcoin Intents technical analysis attracting **15.7k viewers**
- Weekly features in **BTCBoard’s Sunday Bitcoin recaps**
- Hundreds of community interactions and technical clarifications

A key highlight was the **July 7 AMA**, co-hosted with **BOB and Concero**, which attracted **750 unique live listeners** and sparked in-depth discussion on Bitcoin intents and DeFi accessibility.

We also maintained a constant presence through comments and community support.

## Organic Reach at Scale

Combined reach surpassed **300,000 organic impressions** — a level typically requiring substantial marketing budgets, achieved here entirely through community-driven content.

---

## Results and Key Takeaways

Quality technical content driven by genuine conviction produced measurable impact.

Our audience — already focused on Bitcoin L2s and BTCFi — received deeper insight into BOB’s innovations beyond surface-level announcements. BOB gained sustained visibility among Bitcoin-focused users, particularly through BTCBoard and our Asian market reach.

We learned that flexible partnership structures enable authentic collaboration. Maintaining editorial independence while supporting BOB demonstrated that ambassador programs can adapt to media platforms covering multiple projects without sacrificing credibility.

---

## Looking Forward

BOB showed us that community-first partnerships can deliver real results without massive marketing spend.

This experience now serves as a playbook for how we approach future collaborations.
